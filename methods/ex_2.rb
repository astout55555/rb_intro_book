#What do the following expressions evaluate to?

x = 2
# 2

puts x = 2
# nil

p name = "Joe"
# "Joe"

four = "four"
# "four"

print something = "nothing"
# "nothing" <= incorrect, the answer was nil

# I put in my guesses, now let's evaluate in irb.
# I was wrong on #5. print returns nil, just like puts (without the newline).
# Only p returns the string.
