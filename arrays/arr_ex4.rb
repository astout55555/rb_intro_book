# what does each method return?

arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]

# 1

arr.index(5) # 8 (WRONG!) answer is actually 3
# index() tells me the index number of the argument/element
# in this case, the index of 5 is 3 (the 4th element)

# 2

# arr.index[5] # this causes an error, not good syntax

# 3

arr[5] # this one actually returns 8, from index position 5
